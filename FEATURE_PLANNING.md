## **Detailed Feature Specifications**

### **1. Markup System (Labor & Materials)**

**âœ… FINALIZED REQUIREMENTS - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Core Business Logic:**
- **Per-category markups**: Independent markup for Materials and Labor (not Permits/Other)
- **Company defaults**: Percent markups only, projects can override
- **Calculation order**: Base Cost â†’ Markup â†’ Discount â†’ Tax
- **Visibility**: Markups hidden from clients, discounts visible
- **Rounding**: Only at final total for maximum accuracy

**Markup Configuration:**
- **Types supported**: Percent or flat amount per category
- **Validation**: 
  - Percent: 0.01% minimum, warning at 100%, hard cap at 300% (with override)
  - Flat: $0.01 minimum, no maximum (business logic validation)
  - No negative values allowed
- **Precision**: Separate fields ensure proper precision:
  - Percent fields: NUMERIC(7,4) for up to 999.9999%
  - Flat fields: NUMERIC(10,2) for currency amounts
- **Smart defaults**: 20% materials, 15% labor for new companies

**Discount System:**
- **Separate from markup**: Independent discount fields with proper precision
- **Validation**: 
  - Percent: 0.01% minimum, warning when discount > project total
  - Flat: $0.01 minimum, warning when discount > project total
  - No negative values allowed
- **Application**: Applied after markup, visible to clients
- **Use cases**: Property damage, complaint resolution, negotiated credits

**Audit & Compliance:**
- **Audit trail**: `markup_changes` table tracking who/what/when
- **Financial tracking**: Complete history of markup modifications
- **User warnings**: UI alerts for high markups and excessive discounts

**Database Design:**
```sql
-- Project markup fields (separate columns for precision)
material_markup_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'percent' -- 'percent' or 'flat'
material_markup_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.0    -- Percentage values  
material_markup_flat NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0      -- Currency values
labor_markup_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'percent'
labor_markup_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.0
labor_markup_flat NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0

-- Discount fields with proper precision
material_discount_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'percent'
material_discount_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.0
material_discount_flat NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0
labor_discount_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'percent'
labor_discount_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.0
labor_discount_flat NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0
project_discount_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'percent'
project_discount_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.0
project_discount_flat NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0

-- Company defaults (percent only)
default_material_markup_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.2000  -- 20%
default_labor_markup_percent NUMERIC(7,4) DEFAULT 0.1500     -- 15%

-- Audit trail
CREATE TABLE markup_changes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id INTEGER REFERENCES projects(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  field_changed VARCHAR(50),
  old_value VARCHAR(20),
  new_value VARCHAR(20),
  change_reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**User Experience:**
- **Input format**: Percentage with % suffix, currency with $ prefix
- **Warnings**: Visual indicators for high markups (>100%) and excessive discounts
- **Company settings**: Default markup percentages per category
- **Project override**: Easy per-project markup customization
- **Calculation preview**: Real-time total updates as markups/discounts change

---

### **3. Estimate Generation**

**Agreed Requirements:**
- PDF-based estimate generation
- Include cost breakdown (Materials, Labor, Permits, Other, Markup, Tax)
- Editable legal text section
- Print/email capability
- Client signature capture
- **Lock estimate once submitted/signed** (read-only snapshot)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **PDF Generation**: Server-side using `WeasyPrint` (excellent CSS support) or `pdfkit` (HTML-based)
- **Client Access**: Anonymous estimate viewing via shareable links
- **Estimate States**: `draft` â†’ `sent` â†’ `viewed` â†’ `signed` â†’ `locked`

**Electronic Signature Phased Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Draw-to-sign canvas (familiar UX, simple implementation)
2. **Phase 2**: Typed name + checkbox + timestamp (legally sufficient for most cases)
3. **Phase 3**: DocuSign/HelloSign API integration (full compliance, robust audit trail)

**Legal Framework - RESOLVED:**
- **Estimate Legal Status**: Treat as formal "offer" that becomes binding only upon signature with legal disclaimers
- **User Control**: Toggle option for whether estimate is considered binding
- **Default Disclaimer**: "This estimate is not a contract unless signed and accompanied by a mutually agreed work start date."
- **Legal Boilerplate**: Editor can include "Signed estimate constitutes agreement to proceed."

**Implementation Approach:**
- Legal-lite for MVP with flexibility for contract-ready use
- User-configurable binding vs good faith estimate classification
- Comprehensive audit trail for all estimate interactions

**Remaining Questions:**
- How do clients receive estimates? (Email link with anonymous access - CONFIRMED)
- What happens when estimates expire? (automatic status change, notification)
- How granular should cost breakdowns be? (category totals vs line items)

---

### **4. Change Order System**

**Agreed Requirements:**
- Log all estimate modifications post-signature
- Show diffs between original and revised scope/cost
- Timestamped change approvals with notes
- Client-visible history section

**Technical Implementation Strategy:**
- **Create new estimate versions** rather than modifying originals
- Maintain complete audit trail of who changed what when
- **Clear approval workflow**: pending â†’ approved â†’ rejected

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
- Should change orders require re-signature or just approval?
- How do we handle partial change order approvals?
- What level of detail should change diffs show?
- Should clients be able to request changes directly in the system?

**Data Structure Decisions:**
- Use estimate versioning with change tracking
- Store approval metadata (user, timestamp, notes)
- Link change orders to specific project phases if applicable

---

### **5. Legal Boilerplate Templates**

**Agreed Requirements:**
- Editable boilerplate templates for estimates/invoices
- Project-level and company-level customization
- Common construction industry clauses

**Technical Implementation:**
- Store templates in database with versioning
- Support rich text editing (not just plain text)
- Include merge fields for dynamic data (project name, dates, amounts)
- **CRITICAL**: Clear disclaimer that this is convenience only, not legal advice

**Standard Clauses to Include:**
- Scope of work definition
- Payment terms (due dates, late fees)
- Permitting responsibilities
- Dispute resolution process
- Warranty and liability disclaimers
- Change order process agreement

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
- Should we provide industry-standard templates out of the box?
- How do we handle template versioning for legal compliance?
- What merge fields are most important?
- Should we integrate with legal document services?

- Different rates for different service types

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
- Should trip charges be per-project or per-invoice?
- How do trip charges interact with markup and tax calculation order?
- What are common contractor patterns for trip charge billing?

---

## **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### **Database Schema Strategy**
**RESOLVED - Compromise Approach:**
- **Current Phase**: Maintain single-file structure for `models.py` and `schemas.py`
- **Post-Estimate Milestone**: Plan deliberate refactor after core financial features complete
- **Rationale**: Avoid premature optimization while acknowledging future complexity will require cleanup

**Implementation Plan:**
- Continue with current structure through sales tax, markup, and estimate features
- Create cleanup milestone once financial feature complexity grows
- Domain-based separation: `user.py`, `project.py`, `invoice.py`, `estimate.py`

### **PDF Generation Strategy**
**RESOLVED - Server-side Approach:**
- **Recommended**: `WeasyPrint` (excellent CSS support) or `pdfkit` (HTML-based)
- **Rationale**: Server-side generation for legally-sensitive documents provides better control and consistency
- **Future Consideration**: Third-party services (Docmosis, PDFMonkey) if layout complexity grows significantly

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Full control over PDF rendering
- Consistent output across environments  
- Better security for sensitive financial documents
- Professional layout capabilities with CSS
