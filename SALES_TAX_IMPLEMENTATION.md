# Sales Tax Implementation: Phased Development Plan

## **Overview**
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for sales tax functionality, broken into 6 bite-sized phases with clear success criteria and approval gates.

## **Implementation Rules**
- ‚úÖ **Stop at the end of each phase** to verify success criteria
- ‚úÖ **Get positive affirmation** before proceeding to next phase
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** at each phase boundary
- ‚úÖ **Commit frequently** with focused, small commits
- ‚úÖ **Ask for approval** - err on the side of too much rather than too little

---

## **Phase 1: Database Foundation** ‚è±Ô∏è *30-45 mins*
**Goal**: Add models and run migration safely

### **Tasks:**

#### **1A: Add CompanySettings Model** *(15 mins)*
- Add `CompanySettings` model to `backend/app/models/models.py`
- Fields: `id`, `user_id` (FK), `default_sales_tax_rate` (Decimal(5,4))
- Standard timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

#### **1B: Add Project Tax Fields** *(15 mins)*  
- Add to existing `Project` model in `models.py`:
  - `sales_tax_rate` - Decimal(5,4), default=0.0
  - `sales_tax_amount` - Decimal(10,2), default=0.0
  - `is_tax_exempt` - Boolean, default=False
  - `total_with_tax` - Decimal(10,2), default=0.0

#### **1C: Update Schemas** *(15 mins)*
- Update `backend/app/schemas/schemas.py`:
  - Add tax fields to `Project`, `ProjectCreate`, `ProjectUpdate`, `ProjectWithClient`
  - Create `CompanySettings`, `CompanySettingsCreate`, `CompanySettingsUpdate` schemas

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Run `python3 run.py` locally
2. Check database migration runs without errors
3. Visit `/docs` to verify new fields appear
4. Test existing project API calls still work

### **‚úÖ Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Local database migrated without errors
- [ ] All existing projects have `sales_tax_rate = 0.0`, `is_tax_exempt = false`
- [ ] FastAPI docs show new fields in project schemas
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing `/projects/` endpoints
- [ ] Can still create/edit projects without tax fields

### **üõë APPROVAL GATE: Wait for positive confirmation before Phase 2**

---

## **Phase 2: Company Settings API** ‚è±Ô∏è *45-60 mins*
**Goal**: Add company settings endpoints

### **Tasks:**

#### **2A: Create Company Settings API** *(30 mins)*
- Create `backend/app/api/company.py` router
- Add endpoints:
  - `GET /company/settings` - Get current user's company settings
  - `PUT /company/settings` - Update company settings
- Include `Depends(get_current_user)` dependency injection
- Handle case where settings don't exist (return defaults)

#### **2B: Add Router to Main App** *(15 mins)*
- Register company router in `backend/app/main.py`
- Add appropriate tags for API documentation

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Check `/docs` shows new company settings endpoints
2. Test GET `/company/settings` (should return defaults if none exist)
3. Test PUT `/company/settings` with sample data
4. Verify settings are user-specific (different users get different settings)

### **‚úÖ Phase 2 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Company settings endpoints visible in `/docs`
- [ ] GET `/company/settings` returns default values for new users
- [ ] PUT `/company/settings` successfully saves and persists data
- [ ] Settings isolated per user (proper user dependency injection)
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid tax rates

### **üõë APPROVAL GATE: Wait for positive confirmation before Phase 3**

## **Phase 3: Tax Calculation Logic** ‚è±Ô∏è *45-60 mins*
**Goal**: Implement tax calculation in project updates

### **Tasks:**

#### **3A: Update Project Calculation Helper** *(30 mins)*
- Create `calculate_project_totals()` helper function
- Calculation order: Base Cost ‚Üí Markup ‚Üí Tax ‚Üí Total
- Handle `is_tax_exempt` override (sets tax to 0)
- Round tax to nearest cent using proper decimal arithmetic
- Return calculated `sales_tax_amount` and `total_with_tax`

#### **3B: Integrate with Project Update API** *(15 mins)*
- Call calculation helper in project update endpoint
- Save calculated values to database
- Ensure recalculation happens on every project update

#### **3C: Default Tax Rate Lookup** *(15 mins)*
- When creating new projects, fetch company default tax rate
- Fall back to 0.0 if no company settings exist

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Create test project with known values
2. Verify calculation: $1000 base + 10% markup + 8.75% tax = $1,196.25
3. Test tax exempt override (should show $0 tax)
4. Test company default inheritance for new projects

### **‚úÖ Phase 3 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Project totals calculate correctly: base ‚Üí markup ‚Üí tax ‚Üí total
- [ ] Tax calculation rounds to nearest cent properly
- [ ] Tax exempt projects show $0 tax regardless of rate
- [ ] New projects inherit company default tax rate
- [ ] Existing projects maintain their 0% tax rate when edited
- [ ] All calculations are accurate to the penny

### **üõë APPROVAL GATE: Wait for positive confirmation before Phase 4**

- Convert percentage input (8.75%) to decimal (0.0875) for API
- Show validation errors and warnings clearly

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Access company settings page from sidebar
2. Test tax rate input with valid values (0%, 8.75%, 25%)
3. Test validation (negative values, >50%)
4. Test warning display for >25%
5. Verify changes save and persist across page refreshes

### **‚úÖ Phase 4 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Company settings page accessible from sidebar navigation
- [ ] Tax rate input accepts percentage format (with % suffix)
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid rates (0-50% range)
- [ ] Warning indicator appears for rates >25%

## **Success Scenario Testing Matrix**

| Scenario | Expected Result |
|----------|----------------|
| New user, no company settings | Projects default to 0% tax |
| Set company default to 8.75% | New projects inherit 8.75% |
| Project: $1000 base, 10% markup, 8.75% tax | Total: $1,196.25 |
| Same project marked tax exempt | Total: $1,100.00 (no tax) |
| Edit project tax rate to 10% | Recalculates with new rate |
| Tax rate input validation | Rejects <0% or >50% |
| Tax rate >25% | Shows warning indicator |

---

## **Rollback Plan**
If any phase fails its success criteria:
1. **Stop immediately** - do not proceed to next phase
2. **Identify the issue** - review error logs and testing results
3. **Fix the problem** - address the specific failure
4. **Re-test the phase** - verify success criteria are met
5. **Get approval** - confirm resolution before continuing

## **Deployment Notes**
- All phases can be tested locally before staging deployment
- Phase 6 includes staging deployment and verification
- Production deployment only after successful staging verification and final approval

**REMEMBER: Ask for explicit approval at every approval gate! üõë**

## **üéØ CURRENT STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE WITH ACTIVE BUG**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES (ALL 6 PHASES DONE)**
All 6 phases of the original plan have been successfully implemented and tested. Sales tax functionality is working in production.

### **üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED**
During implementation, we discovered and fixed several critical issues:

1. **‚úÖ Tax recalculation bug**: Fixed issue where tax totals didn't update when subproject items were added/modified
   - **Solution**: Added `calculate_project_totals()` calls to all 12 subproject item CRUD endpoints in `/backend/app/api/subprojects.py`
   - **Result**: Tax totals now update in real-time when materials, labor, permits, or other costs are modified

2. **‚úÖ Tax inheritance bug**: Fixed issue where new projects weren't inheriting company default tax rate in the form
   - **Solution**: Updated `ProjectModal.tsx` to fetch company settings and pre-populate tax rate field
   - **Result**: New project forms now show company default (e.g., 8%) instead of starting at 0%

3. **‚úÖ Input format consistency**: Fixed inconsistent tax rate input formats between company and project levels
   - **Solution**: Standardized both to use percentage format with proper decimal conversion
   - **Result**: Consistent UX across all tax rate inputs

4. **‚úÖ Precision/rounding issues**: Fixed floating point precision errors showing values like 6.98% instead of 7.0%
   - **Solution**: Added proper decimal arithmetic and rounding in both frontend and backend
   - **Result**: Tax rates display correctly without precision artifacts

### **üö® ACTIVE ISSUE: SUBPROJECT TAX DISPLAY**
**Location**: Subproject details page  
**Problem**: Tax still displays as 0 even though backend API was updated to include tax calculations  
**Status**: Backend fix applied, frontend integration pending  

**Backend Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Updated `CostSummary` schema in `schemas.py` to include tax fields:
  ```typescript
  sales_tax_rate: Optional[str] = None
  sales_tax_amount: Optional[str] = None  
  is_tax_exempt: Optional[bool] = False
  total_with_tax: Optional[str] = None
  ```
- ‚úÖ Updated subproject cost summary endpoint to calculate and return tax data using project-level tax settings

**Next Steps Needed**:
1. Find the subproject details page component that displays the cost summary
2. Update it to pass the new tax fields to the `CostSummary` component  
3. Verify the `CostSummary` component can handle the tax fields from subproject data
4. Test that subproject tax display matches project-level tax display

**Files Involved**:
- Backend: `/backend/app/api/subprojects.py` (‚úÖ updated)
- Backend: `/backend/app/schemas/schemas.py` (‚úÖ updated)  
- Frontend: Need to find subproject details page (üîç investigation needed)
- Frontend: `/frontend/src/components/CostSummary.tsx` (may need updates)

### **üìã IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**
**Total Development Time**: ~8 hours across multiple sessions  
**Files Modified**: 10+ files across frontend/backend  
**Features Added**:
- Company-level default tax rate configuration
- Project-level tax rate override and tax exemption
- Real-time tax calculations on subproject item changes
- Tax breakdown display in project and subproject views
- Form inheritance of company defaults
- Consistent percentage input formats
- Proper decimal precision handling

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Tax calculated from subproject totals (not obsolete project-level cost fields)
- Frontend-only inheritance logic (removed duplicate backend inheritance)
- Decimal precision using `parseFloat((rate / 100).toFixed(4))` pattern
- Centralized calculation logic in `utils/calculations.py`

### **üîß DEBUGGING CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSION**
When resuming, focus on the subproject tax display issue:
1. The backend API now returns tax data in the cost summary
2. Need to trace how the frontend consumes this data
3. Look for subproject details page/component that shows cost breakdowns
4. Ensure tax fields are being passed through to display components

The core sales tax feature is complete and working - this is just a display issue on the subproject view.
